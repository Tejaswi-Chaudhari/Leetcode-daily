# Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).  
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.  
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.  

Notice that you may not slant the container.  

Example 1:  
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]  
Output: 49   

Example 2:  
Input: height = [1,1]  
Output: 1  
 

Constraints:  
n == height.length  
2 <= n <= 105  
0 <= height[i] <= 104
